# The Pattern Mill

### Overview <hr>

The Pattern Mill is a full stack website integrating all skills learned throughout the course

- A title
- Address of the trail
- Difficulty level, Easy, moderate or hard
- Description
- Directions
- Photos
- Maps

The site will also provide a comment section where users can give opinions or tips and advice on the trails, where to eat, sleep nearby etc.

I have created two profiles for testing purposes:
1. Username:Inesita, Password:inesita
2. Username:Admin, Password:admin

### UX <hr>

#### Project Goals 

The goal of this project is to creat a fullstack site 

#### User Goals

1. To be able to search and browse through trails in Andalucia.

2. Find all the information necessary for each trail like distance, difficulty level, address and directions.

3. To create a personal profile to upload and store trails.

4. To be able to register and create a profile easily.

5. Find out more information on potential trails by reading comments and asking questions.

6. Become part of a hiking community and give tips and advice to other hikers.

9. As a regular user I want to be able to upload my own trails to share with the community and get opinions on my trail.

10. As someone who is interested in hiking in Andalucia I want to find trails that will suit my needs.

11. As someone who isn't used to hiking I would like to find trails which are easy to moderate level.

12. As a very experienced hiker, I hope to find difficult trails that will challenge me.

13. As a regular user I hope to meet other users who live in my area and can organise hikes together.

14. As a user I would like to be able to see more posts and photos on the sites social media sites.

#### Site Owner Goals

15. Design a site which represents the services offered and will appeal to the target market using appropriate colour schemes, imagery, typography and useful information.

16. Ensure the site is easy to navigate and all information can be found by visitors within seconds.

17. Ensure the registration process is simple and fast.

18. Increase website traffic from the target audience using tools such as google analytics, blogging and social media.

19. Produce a site which is easily accessible on all sizes, mobile devices and browsers.

20. To eventually gain revenue from the site through affiliated links and advertsiing. Potential clients could be sports shops, hotels ,restaurants and tour companies.

23. Recognisable format, no surprises.

24. A well designed, aesthetically pleasing user interface.

25. For all navigation links to function correctly and create an easy route.

26. All information added is saved and easily accessible. 


### DESIGN <hr>

#### DESIGN CHOICES

I have used a clean, simple design throughout the site to make it easily accessible across all mediums and give the user the information they need without feeling overwhelmed by too many images and too much information.


#### COLOURS

I chose this color scheme as it reflects the colours of nature while assuring readabilty and accessability. I think these shades of green and brown go well together and are in line with the simplistic design of the site.


- ![#00695c](https://via.placeholder.com/15/00695c/000000?text=+) `#00695c`
- ![#3e2723](https://via.placeholder.com/15/3e2723/000000?text=+) `#3e2723`


#### FONTS

The fonts I use for this project are Alegreya Sans and Merriweather Sans. These fonts compliment each other well and create a pleasant feel for users. 


#### IMAGES

Images used on the landing page were borrowed from a friend Lena Marie Anderson from a trail she hiked in Cadiz, Guadalete Park, Andalucia.

### BUGS FOUND AND THEIR FIXES <hr>

1. The major bug I had a problem with throughout this project was with an application error everytime I tried to open my Heroku App. This was eventually fixed by removing unused files I had uploaded to my root at the beginning of my project while trying to fix an issue with my database. Heroku was trying to open these files and as a result I kept getting a H10 error and pymong was crashing. Deleting these files and cleaning up my workspace cleared the issue and Heroku runs with no problems.

2. For a while my env.py file would disappear everytime I opened my project after closing it down. I was clicking on the green gitpod button and realised I have to go to gitpod dashboard to open my workspace instead of going directly from github.

3. I had a lot of template syntax errors throughout the project which usually resulted in mistakes made with PEP8 compliance and repeating functions and empty quotes. Also typos caused me a lot of headaches and I spent many hours/days going through my code trying to spot them.

4. The python tools server crashed 3 times in the last 3 minutes was an alert I came across many times. When I deleted unused files from my root this was ammended.

5. I had a lot of issues wiring up my flask app to MongoDB at the beginning of the project. I reviewed the Go Humungous with MongoDB Atlas section of the course and manipulated my data programmatically with python to get a feel of where I was going wrong and to see the data being uploaded to my console. This helped give me a greater understanding of the database structure and I got it in the end.

    
### Deployment

## Project creation

The project was created by logging into Github, using the following steps: -
 - Create an account using an email address and password or a google account
 - Log in to account and create a new repository using Code institutes template.
 - Name the repository based on your project name and be sure to include project 3. Then click the green Gitpod button which will take you to Gitpod. 
 - Open the platform and start coding

 ## Sign-in or sign-up to MongoDB

Sign-in or sign-up to MongoDB and create a new cluster
Within the Sandbox, click the collections button and after click Create Database

I set up the following collections: comments, trails, ratings and users. However I only used the trails and users collections.

# Trails Collection

Key                | Value     | Information
-------------------|-----------|-------------
_id                | ObjectId  | Automatically generated by MongoDB
trail_title        | String    | creates a title
trail_address      | String    | creates an address
trail_created_by   | String    | shows who added the trail
trail_description  | String    | Describes the trail
trail_difficulty   | String    | Choose a level of difficulty. Easy moderate or hard
trail_directions   | String    | Gives trail directions

# Users Collection

Key        | Value     | Information
-----------| ----------|------------------------
_id        | ObjectId  | Automatically generated by MongoDB
first_name | String    | Collects first name
last_name  | String    | collects last name
username   | String    | collects username
password   | String    | stores password


Next, under the Security Menu on the left, select Database Access.

Add a new database user, and keep the credentials secure

Within the Network Access option, add IP Address 0.0.0.0

In your IDE, create a file containing your environmental variables called env.py at the root level of the application. It will need to contain the following lines and variables:

- import os

- os.environ["IP"] = "0.0.0.0"
- os.environ["PORT"] = "5000"
- os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
- os.environ["DEBUG"] = "True"
- os.environ["MONGO_URI"] = "YOUR_MONGODB_URI"
- os.environ["MONGO_DBNAME"]= "DATABASE_NAME" 

Please note that you will need to update the SECRET_KEY with your own secret key, as well as the MONGO_URI and MONGO_DBNAME variables with those provided by MongoDB.

To find your MONGO_URI, go to your clusters and click on connect. Choose connect your application and copy the link provided. Don't forget to update the necessary fields like password and database name.

If you plan on pushing this application to a public repository, ensure that env.py is added to your .gitignore file.

The application can now be run locally. In your terminal, type the following command

python3 app.py. 

## Deploying on Heroku:

Register for your free Heroku account and create a new app. Choose your region.
Give the app your project name and choose what region you are in then click 'Create app'.
Go to the settings tab and find the Config Vars section. Click 'Reveal Config Vars'.
Ensure the Procfile and requirements.txt files exist are present and up-to-date in your local repository. For example: -

pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
Procfile: echo web: python app.py > Procfile
The Procfile should contain the following line:
web: python app.py

Scroll down to "deployment method"-section. Choose "Github" for automatic deployment.
From the inputs below, make sure your github user is selected, and then enter the name for your repo. Click "search". When it finds the repo, click the "connect" button.
Scroll back up and click "settings". Scroll down and click "Reveal config vars". Set up the same variables as in your env.py (IP, PORT, SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI and MONGODB_NAME): Do not set the DEBUG variable here. This should be set to False before deployment.


- IP = 0.0.0.0
- PORT = 5000
- SECRET_KEY = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
- MONGO_URI = YOUR_MONGODB_URI
- MONGO_DBNAME = DATABASE_NAME

Scroll back up and click "Deploy". Scroll down and click "Enable automatic deployment".
Just beneath, click "Deploy branch". Heroku will now start building the app. When the build is complete, click "view app" to open it.
In order to commit your changes to the branch, use git push within gitpod to push your changes

### CHANGES TO IMPLEMENT AND INCLUDE<hr>

Due to time constraints I did not manage to create a function to upload photos and maps to the site. I would also like to include a comment section below each trail so users can give their opinion on trails, ask questions or give advice. I would like to also include a rating function so the home page can include a trail of the day based on popularity. I hope to implement these in the future.

### CREDITS<hr>

#### Code

I relied heavily on code used in the Code Institutes tutorials to help me with this project, especially Code Institutes Data-Centric mini project. I used these tutorials to guide me through the process of creating this site and all the functionality needed. I ammended the code to suit my own project.

I also used materialize to create responsive layouts. I was keen to try using this platform as it is new to me.


#### Images

Images were borrowed from a friend from her own personal collection.

 
 ### ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS<hr><hr>
 Thank you to my mentor Mo Shami for getting me started on the project and veering me onto the right track. 
 Thank you to Code Institutes' Student care team for all their help.
 And thanks to Jo from student support who helped me greatly in fixing the problem I had with Heroku app.
